Hi! Here, I experiment with data visualization using Python, balancing art 
and science to convey the message behind the data accurately and 
effectively. 

In this, I'm honing my skills in data collection, data wrangling, choosing 
different charts, and writing code using various libraries, like 
NumPy, Pandas,Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.
